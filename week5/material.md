# But first Read this

Ideally we should learn langchain (framework) but its slowly being depreciated and not actively managed anymore by LANGCHAIN (company), thus we will be working with langgraph.

## What is LangChain?

LangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides a modular, flexible structure for integrating LLMs with external data sources, tools, and memory management, enabling developers to create sophisticated AI-driven applications like chatbots, content generators, and personal assistants. At its core, LangChain allows developers to chain together operations—such as retrieving data, processing it, and generating responses—in a streamlined pipeline. This modularity makes it easy to connect LLMs with APIs, databases, or web scrapers, and to incorporate memory for context-aware interactions.[](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/)[](https://medium.com/%40tahirbalarabe2/%25EF%25B8%258Flangchain-vs-langgraph-a-comparative-analysis-ce7749a80d9c)

### Key Components of LangChain
- **Chains**: Sequences of operations (e.g., retrieve data → summarize → answer) that form the backbone of LangChain’s workflows.
- **Agents**: Components that enable LLMs to make decisions, use tools, and dynamically respond to user input.
- **Memory**: Mechanisms to retain context across interactions, crucial for conversational applications.
- **Document Loaders and Tools**: Integrations for fetching and processing external data, like web content or database queries.

LangChain’s flexibility and extensive integrations make it a go-to framework for developers building LLM-powered applications, from simple question-answering bots to complex multi-step workflows.[](https://oxylabs.io/blog/langgraph-vs-langchain)

LangChain’s ability to future-proof AI stacks by supporting multiple model providers and its open-source nature have made it a favorite among developers building everything from simple chatbots to enterprise-grade solutions.

## Limitations of LangChain and How LangGraph Solves Them

While LangChain excels at linear workflows, it has limitations when handling complex, dynamic, or stateful processes. LangGraph, a specialized library within the LangChain ecosystem, was introduced to address these challenges by offering a graph-based approach for orchestrating multi-agent, cyclical workflows. Below are LangChain’s key limitations and how LangGraph overcomes them:

### 1. **Limited Support for Complex, Nonlinear Workflows**
   - **LangChain Limitation**: LangChain’s pipeline-based structure (using DAGs) is ideal for sequential tasks but struggles with workflows requiring branching, concurrency, or cycles. For example, managing multiple agents or tasks with interdependencies can become cumbersome and hard to scale.[](https://www.projectpro.io/article/langchain-vs-langgraph/1123)
   - **LangGraph Solution**: LangGraph uses a graph-based architecture where nodes represent tasks or agents, and edges define transitions, including loops and conditional logic. This allows for flexible, nonlinear workflows, such as task management systems where actions depend on evolving conditions or user input.[](https://medium.com/%40tahirbalarabe2/%25EF%25B8%258Flangchain-vs-langgraph-a-comparative-analysis-ce7749a80d9c)[](https://cobusgreyling.medium.com/langgraph-from-langchain-explained-in-simple-terms-f7cd0c12cdbf)

### 2. **Challenges with Stateful Workflows**
   - **LangChain Limitation**: LangChain struggles to preserve long-term memory or manage dynamic context across complex workflows, limiting its performance in systems requiring ongoing state retention or multi-session interactions.[](https://www.projectpro.io/article/langchain-vs-langgraph/1123)
   - **LangGraph Solution**: LangGraph treats state as a first-class citizen, with each node able to access and update a shared state. This enables persistent memory and seamless context retention across sessions, ideal for applications like virtual assistants or multi-agent systems. For instance, LangGraph’s integration with tools like Zep enhances memory management for consistent, user-centric interactions.[](https://www.getzep.com/ai-agents/langchain-agents-langgraph)[](https://www.projectpro.io/article/langchain-vs-langgraph/1123)

### 3. **Lack of Granular Control Over Agent Actions**
   - **LangChain Limitation**: LangChain agents are powerful for prototyping but can be hard to control in production due to their free-form nature. This lack of constraints can lead to unpredictable behavior, especially in applications requiring compliance or security.[](https://www.softgrade.org/langchain-agents-vs-langgraph/)
   - **LangGraph Solution**: LangGraph provides granular control over agent actions through conditional edges and human-in-the-loop approvals. Developers can define precise workflows, pause for human intervention, or add moderation checks, making it suitable for production-grade applications like compliance monitoring or customer support automation.[](https://www.softgrade.org/langchain-agents-vs-langgraph/)[](https://orq.ai/blog/langchain-vs-langgraph)

### 4. **Complexity in Managing Multi-Agent Systems**
   - **LangChain Limitation**: Coordinating multiple agents or handling tasks with complex dependencies is challenging in LangChain’s linear structure, often requiring extensive custom code.[](https://www.curotec.com/insights/langchain-vs-langgraph-framework-comparison/)
